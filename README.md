# Project-Euler
Solutions to project Euler problems using JavaScript.

In no way are these solutions 'perfect' nor are they the only way to tackle each problem. There may be cleaner ways to solve them as well as more efficient.

# How to use
If you're stuck on how to create your function in JS or something is just not working as expected, have a look at my answer. Each file posted will either include whether it was completed and correct or not.

Preferably you use this repo to look at how to answer the problems in JS before attempting in a different language so you're not directly copying the answer and not learning anything!

All answers have been commented under each function where possible.
